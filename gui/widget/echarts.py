"""The app's single seam onto ipecharts (Apache ECharts for ipywidgets).

Every chart in the app renders through ``EChartsChart``. Callers hand over a
plain, serializable ECharts option ``dict`` and a renderer choice; nothing
outside this module needs to know that ipecharts exists, which keeps the chart
builders (``gui/scripts/*``) pure and unit-testable.

Why ``EChartsRawWidget`` and not ``EChartsWidget``: ipecharts ships both. Its
``EChartsWidget.option`` trait is ``Instance(Option)`` — a tree of 57 typed
sub-widget traits (``Title``, ``XAxis``, ``seriesitems.Bar``, …) that a caller
must assemble object by object. ``EChartsRawWidget`` overrides that trait with
a plain ``Dict``, taking the option verbatim. Both share one frontend view, so
the raw path costs nothing and lets the chart builders stay dict-only.

The pure half of the adapter — palette, theme colours, option shaping, renderer
names — lives in ``gui/scripts/echarts_options`` so that solara-free chart
builders can import it without dragging solara in. Import that module directly
rather than reaching through this one.

    """Render an ECharts option dict as a chart.

    Args:
        option: plain serializable ECharts option dict.
        identity: optional string folding in *extrinsic* rebuild triggers —
            see below. Callers with none can leave it out.
        dark: True for the app's dark theme.
        renderer: ``RENDERER_SVG`` (default, small bar charts) or
            ``RENDERER_CANVAS`` (high-point-count scatter).
        height: CSS pixel height of the chart container.
        option_digest: optional caller-supplied stand-in for the option hash —
            see "Skipping the hash" below. ``None`` (the default) keeps the
            adapter hashing the option itself.

    The widget is built inside a ``use_memo`` keyed on a digest of ``option``
    plus the presentation inputs and ``identity``, so a re-render that changes
    none of them reuses the same widget (no chart teardown, no flicker), while
    a change to any of them builds a fresh one. Recreating rather than mutating
    keeps the option dict and the live chart from drifting apart, and leaves no
    trait observers behind: the widget owns all its own state, and the
    ``use_effect`` below closes the one it replaces so nothing outlives the
    render that dropped it.

    **Contract:** anything that changes what the chart *draws* is already
    covered — this component hashes the option itself, so a caller can rebuild
    its option dict every render and rely on the digest to decide. Callers do
    NOT need to enumerate the option's inputs anywhere.

    ``identity`` is for the opposite case: inputs that are NOT visible in the
    option yet must still force a fresh widget. Two known kinds:

    * **Attach timing.** ipecharts sizes its chart when the widget is attached
      to the DOM and on window resize; it does not watch the container for
      later size changes, so a chart mounted while its tab was hidden can be
      mis-sized. Putting the active tab index in ``identity`` forces a rebuild
      on tab entry. (Mitigation only — NOT verified in a browser; ipecharts has
      no ResizeObserver and no after-show handling.)
    * **Live chart state.** Interaction state (legend toggles, zoom) lives in
      the chart instance, not in the option. Where reusing a widget across a
      change of subject would carry that state over — e.g. switching to another
      evaluation run that happens to draw an identical option — name the
      subject in ``identity``.

    A wrong ``identity`` now costs at most an unnecessary rebuild; it can no
    longer render stale data.

    **Skipping the hash.** Hashing the option is cheap for a bar chart (1.2 ms
    at 1k values) and expensive for a dense scatter: re-measured 2026-07-21 on
    the scatter's real option, 2.9 ms at 2k points, 118 ms at 50k and 470 ms at
    200k — per render, in a dialog the user is interacting with. Those are
    order-of-magnitude figures from one dev machine that was also running a dev
    server, not constants (an earlier pass on the same code quoted 63/239 ms);
    what is stable is that the cost grows superlinearly with point count. A caller
    that already knows a cheap, complete identity for its option may pass it as
    ``option_digest``, and the adapter uses that INSTEAD of hashing (see
    ``gui.scripts.evaluation_echarts.pred_obs_chart_identity``, derived from one
    ``stat()``).

    That inverts the contract above, so it is opt-in and the caller takes on the
    obligation the adapter otherwise carries: **``option_digest`` must change
    whenever anything in ``option`` changes.** A digest that misses an input
    renders a stale chart with no error anywhere — precisely the failure mode
    the default path exists to prevent. Use it only where the option is a pure
    function of inputs the caller can name exhaustively and cheaply. The
    presentation inputs (``dark``, ``renderer``, ``height``) stay in the memo
    key either way, so a digest never has to account for them.
