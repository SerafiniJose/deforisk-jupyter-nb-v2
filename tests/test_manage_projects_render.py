"""The manage-projects widgets actually mount — and every row deletes ITS OWN row.

The other manage-projects tests are source-substring checks. ``assert "on_delete("
in src`` passes just as happily against a late-binding closure (``lambda:
on_delete(info)``, no ``info=info`` default), where *every* row's trash button
hands up the LAST project in the list — i.e. it offers to delete GUY and erases
someone else's folder instead. On an irreversible, multi-GB delete that is the
worst bug in the feature, and nothing but a render can catch it: these components
are only exercised here.

Row order is the widget-tree order, so the trash buttons come back in list order —
the broken closure yields ``["broken", "broken"]`` where the fixed one yields
``["GUY", "broken"]``.
